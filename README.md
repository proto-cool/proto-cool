# hi, i'm protocol7 👋

I'm a full-stack software developer who likes to write code sometimes. Even more rarely, the code works. And sometimes, the code is even good!

- 🧑‍💻 I work on the `frontend`:
   - `Astro`, `React`, `Tailwind`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `static sites`, `SPAs`... 
- ... and on the `backend`:
   - `Python`, `Node.js`, `.NET`, `RBDMSes`, `REST APIs`, `GraphQL APIs`...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about **containerization** and **productionizing** my work.
- 🤖 I sometimes work with **AI classification** to assist humans with process automation
- 💬 Ask me about **programming**, **3D printing**, **general computing**, or anything else! We all benefit with shared knowledge.
- 📍 I'm from the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. 💙 🇺🇸
